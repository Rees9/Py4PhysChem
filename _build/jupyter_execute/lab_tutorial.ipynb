    "Spectroscopy is the study of the interaction between matter and electromagnetic waves. Historically, spectroscopy dealt with the electromagnetic radiation in a form of visible light, but it has gradually developed to cover the whole electromagnetic spectrum: from the short-wavelength $\\gamma$- and X-ray radiation through ultraviolet, visible, and infrared light down to the microwave radiation. In this project we are using the infrared (IR) light to study particular types of motion of molecules: vibrations and rotations. \n",
    "\n",
    "What are the merits of the vibrational and rotational spectroscopy? It allows us to infer the geometric structure of a molecule from its absorption spectrum. HCl (shown in Fig. 2) is a polar molecule: atoms carry partial positive +q and negative −q charges. These charges interact with the electric field $\\vec{E}$ of an electromagnetic wave and feel the force. As a result, the molecule starts to spin about its center of mass and also to vibrate as the distance between atoms changes when the charges move in opposite directions following the time-varying electric field. Both phenomena take place simultaneously, which explains why we are dealing with a composite rotational-vibrational spectrum. Vibrations and rotation are not mechanically independent: A rotating molecule experiences the centrifugal force that tries to stretch the molecule and thus vibrations are affected. Vibrations periodically shrink and stretch the molecule, changing the average distance between atoms and affecting spinning. Just like a spinning ice-skater as she pulls her arms closer to her body she spins faster (see Atkins, Chpt. 16), so does the molecule when the bond length decreases.\n",

    "A recorded IR spectrum for a HCl molecule is plotted in Fig. 4. It has the expected structure: there are two series of lines, P and R branches, with a gap between them. This gap, which is a Q branch, would correspond to a pure vibrational (∆v = 1, ∆J = 0) transition with a frequency $\\nu_e$—if it were not forbidden. We observe also that distance between peaks is not quite constant as one would expect from Eq. (1)! For example, for the R branch\n",

The reason for this variable spacing is the following: Typically, a molecular vibration takes on the order of $10^{-14}$ s. A molecular rotation is normally much slower, taking $10^{−9}$ s to $10^{−10}$ s. Hence, as a molecule rotates one revolution, it vibrates many times. To account for this, we have to replace $R_e$ in the deﬁnition of the rotational constant, Eq. (2), with a vibrationally averaged $R$. In the simplest approximation, this leads to the v-dependence of the rotational constant,\n",
