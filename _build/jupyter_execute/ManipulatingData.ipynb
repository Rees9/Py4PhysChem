For example, a value of `34` in the `peaks` array would imply we have a peak located at `data[34]`. For those interested, the underscore in `, _` just represents that for all the other things the function returns, we don't care about them and want to throw them away.\n",

    "- `prominence =` is the most elusive of all but arguably the most useful.
