# How to use this Textbook
## Introduction
This is a work in progress Jupyter Book with tutorial content for doing data analysis in Python with common experimental data formats, with particular focus towards measurements relevant for physical chemistry. Funded by the CTFP, it is tailored towards providing the appropriate resources to students of CHM223 to be able to complete a virtual lab assignment using Python and Jupyter Notebook.

This book is intended to be a starting point for continuous updates, to expand the usability beyond the course for general use by chemistry students at the University of Toronto.
## Tutorial Pages
On the left you can find all the textbook sections to familiarize yourself with using Python for plotting and analyzing experimental data. Each section will be a mix of tutorial, code examples, and interactive elements. 
`````{admonition} For CHM223 students
:class: important
Look out for indicators like this highlighting particularly relevant material to you lab assignment!
`````
## Interactive Elements
On some pages, you will see indication that the code is interactive. On any of these pages, simply click the "Live Code" button at the top and it will load an interactive version which will let you run and edit the code yourself!

Use this to try modifying some of the parameters, switch the data used, or edit the whole code itself. Interacting and experimenting is the best way to learn!
