    "Spectroscopy is the measurement and interpretation of electromagnetic spectra, which offers a powerful toolkit to study the interactions between matter and electromagnetic waves. Historically, spectroscopy begain with studies of electromagnetic radiation in the form of visible light---one could say that our eyes were the first (coarse) spectrometers used for science. However, technological capabilities have gradually developed to cover the whole electromagnetic spectrum: from short-wavelength/high-energy $\\gamma$- and X-ray radiation through ultraviolet, visible, and infrared light, and our to micro- and radio waves. In this virtual lab, we are using infrared (IR) light (with wavelengths $\\lambda$: 800~nm--1000$\\mu$m) to study particular types of molecular motion: vibrations and rotations. \n",
    "\n",
    "Why might we be interested in vibrational and rotational spectroscopy? These techniques allow us to infer the geometric structure of a molecule from its (infrared) absorption spectrum. HCl (shown in Fig. 2) is a highly polar molecule: its atoms carry partial positive +$q$ and negative −$q$ charges. These charges interact with the electric field $\\vec{E}$ of an electromagnetic wave and feel a (time-varying) force. As a result, the molecule starts to spin (about its center of mass) *and* vibrate---where the inter-atomic distance changes when the charges are pushed *in opposite directions* by the electric field. Both phenomena take place simultaneously, which explains why we are dealing with a composite rotational-vibrational spectrum. Further, vibrations and rotation are not mechanically independent: A the atoms in rotating molecule experience a centrifugal force that stretches the bond, moves the molecule from the natural equilibrium in its inter-atomic potential, and thus perturbs the vibrations. Conversely, vibrations periodically shrink and stretch the bond, changing the distance between atoms and affecting the time-averaged *moment of interia*. This in turn pertubs the molecular rotation---just like [an ice-skater pulling their arms closer to their body to speed up their spin.](https://phys.libretexts.org/Courses/Georgia_State_University/GSU-TM-Physics_I_(2211)/08%3A_Mass_and_Inertia/8.08%3A_Moment_of_Inertia_Rotational_Inertia)\n",

    "### 2.1 Selection rules\n",
    "\n",
    "If all possible transitions between vibrational and rotational energy levels were allowed, a hypothetical spectrum would be quite cluttered in the infrared. However, only a small sub-set of the conceivable trainsitions are usually visible in experimental spectra. These few, *allowed* transitions are determined by the physical mechanism of interaction between radiation and matter---as was mentioned in Sec. 1, in the general case a diatomic molecule must have a transition dipole (which is the quantum mechanical analog to polar molecules that are classically vibrating or rotating) to exhibit features in an infrared rotational-vibrational spectrum. Quantum mechanically, we can represent this as a matrix element involving the dipole operator, and use the wavefunctions of the quantum harmonic oscillator or rigid rotor to arrive at the *selection rules* for transitions for a diatomic molecule. In terms of its quantum numbers, these rules imply that the only allowed transitions are those where both quantum numbers change by exactly one:\n",

    "Then, at room temperature, the energy spacing between vibrational levels of HCl is large compared to the characteristic thermal energy, so the overwhelming majority of molecules will be in their ground vibration level prior to exposure to light. As a result the absorption spectrum corresponds to a ∆v = +1 transition (specifically, from $v=0$, the ground vibrational level to $v=1$, the ﬁrst excited state). However, the spacing between the rotational energy levels *is* comparable to the characteristic thermal energy at room temperature, so a variety of staties (*i.e.* values of $J$) will be initially occupied, and we will observe transitions where the final rotational state is either one greater ($J_{final}=J_{initial}+1$), or one less ($J_{final}=J_{initial}-1$) than whichever state a particular molecule occupied prior to photoexcitation. Putting this all together, we have a theoretical model for the experimental spectra, which, for HCl, has an appearance siilar to this:\n",

    "### 2.2 Structure of the IR spectrum\n",
    "An experimental infrared IR spectrum for an HCl molecule is plotted in Fig. 4. It has the expected structure: there are two series of features, the P and R branches, with a gap between them (the missing Q branch). However, we observe that distance between peaks *is not quite constant*, as the form of Eq. (1) predicted! For example, we could use Eq. (1) to work out the expected photon energies corresponding to transitions for the R branch:\n",

    "Then, we could consider the distance (in energy) between neighbouring peaks in the spectrum: $R(J + 1) − R(J) = 2hB_e$. If Eq. (1) were the whole story, the spacing should be a constant!\n",
    "\n",
    "Thought many possibilities could be considered, it turns out that the dominant reason for this variable spacing is the following: Typically, a molecular vibration is fast---taking place on the order of $10^{-14} $ s (10 fs!). By comparison, a molecular rotation is usually much slower, taking $10^{−9}$ s to $10^{−10}$ s (100 ps - 1 ns). Hence, while a rotating molecule makes one revolution, its atoms undergo many cycles of vibration. This means that the instantaneous bond length will sometimes be longer (and sometimes be shorter) than it is at equilibrium. Because the moment of inertia varies non-linearly with $d$, this motion has an asymmetric net effect. To account for this, we can replace the $d_e$ in the deﬁnition of the rotational constant, Eq. (2), with a vibrationally averaged $d$. In the simplest approximation, this leads to a depednence of the rotational constant on $v$, *i.e.* the vibrational quantum number. As a result, we end up with a more complicated expression for the (vibrationally-corrected) rotational constant:\n",

With this correction, our expression for the rotational-vibrational energy (1) needs to be modiﬁed accordingly,\n",

(8), and $n = -J_i$ in Eq. (9), where use $J_i$ to emphasize that this refers to the rotational state of the molecule before absorption of a photon.
